Recently, I've started learning how to write webpages with HTML and CSS, and even more recently, how to style and format those pages with a UI framework called Semantic UI. My immediate reaction was to be frustrated because not only was I unfamiliar with HTML and CSS, but I was also required to learn a new framework on top of that. Unfortunately, I also have very little interest in web design. I don't really enjoy trying to make things pretty, and I don't even really have any idea of what pretty is. It's just not for me. 

From such an introduction, one might think that I had a terrible time writing HTMl, CSS, and learning how to make dropdown menus and images line up with Semantic UI, and to be fair, I had my fair share of frustration from lack of understanding about how Semantic UI and HTML worked together. However, I definitely believe that a webpage made purely with HTML probably wouldn't look as great as one made with a UI framework, and would most certainly require a lot more effort and time to complete. For these reasons, I actually ended up enjoying using and learning Semantic UI, and boy am I glad that someone else wrote something like this for me to use.
