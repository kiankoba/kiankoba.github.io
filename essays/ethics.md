<h3>Introduction</h3>

Oh, ethics. No matter where you go, ethics will always be a controversial topic. In fact, the more places you go to, the more controversial it gets. What’s morally correct to one person might be wrong to someone in another country, and even less than that, moral issues differ greatly between people of just different ethnic backgrounds or religions. Luckily, I’m going to talk about ethics in the context of software engineering, so that should make things quite simpler. As a software engineer, there are a surprisingly large number of things to think about in regards to ethics. To give a brief runover of them, I’ll say that as a software engineer, one should be a generally moral person by doing things such as being honest, trying to positively contribute to society and avoid harming others, but should also do their best to stay true to their contractual and managerial imperatives. Of course, there are other, more minute details such as being true to oneself, trying to create the best product possible, and being supportive and fair to one’s colleagues, but I think that this basic picture of ethics is a sufficient start.

<h3>Ever heard of StreetView?</h3>

In this essay, I chose to evaluate a case study on privacy, in which the main offender is Google’s StreetView feature. As most of us know, Google’s StreetView feature is a feature that allows one to view almost any location on the planet from both aerial and street levels. The issue here is that this data is readily available, and during the collection of this data, images of many individuals and their homes were unknowingly, and in many cases, unwantedly, were captured. Burglars could use pictures of houses to plan robberies, and pictures of sensitive locations such as adult stores and abuse centers also depicted customers walking to and from the stores. Although Google provided a way to report and get rid of such images as a sort of solution, this required that the depicted person in question first be aware of the fact that the image existed. 

<h3>But wait, there's more!</h3>

But that’s not all. A few years later, it was discovered that the vehicles that drove around to take these very images had been collecting personal data from surrounding unencrypted Wi-Fi networks. Among this data were SSIDs, device identifiers, medical and financial records, passwords, and email content. Google tried to blame this on a single “rogue engineer,” but it was later found that he had properly communicated with his superiors regarding the data collection. In association with these actions, Google was determined to have broken numerous laws and eventually settled a lawsuit brought by <b>38</b> states for a mere seven million dollars, and promised to set up an annual privacy week for its employees, which included privacy-related training and education. 

<h3>Not cool.</h3

So, what do we have here? From the information given, we can probably make the assumption that the so-called “rogue programmer” was simply doing his job and Google tried to throw him under the bus. We know that Google took an immeasurable number of images, a great number, if not all, of which were probably not consented to, and that Google also <i>stole</i> people’s data. From any point of view, it’s almost impossible to say that these actions were justified or ethical in any way, shape, or form. From the developer’s point of view, it’s possible to see how refusing to write such code wouldn’t be good because he could face repercussions from the biggest tech company, Google, and I don’t deny that anyone would want that job. However, the potential damage is so large (to the extent that it’s full scope isn’t even clear), that anyone with any morals at all should have no problem at all in attempting to stop this.
