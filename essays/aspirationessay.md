To be completely honest, when I first started majoring in Computer Science at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, I wasn't sure whether or not this major was the major for me. Throughout my education, I had always enjoyed studying math and science much more than things like history and English, and I quite enjoyed using my computer at home, particularly for playing games. It was off of this basis alone that I decided to major in Computer Science. I can now say, however, that I fully believe that I made the right choice when I selected Computer Science as my major. Although first learning how to code was a bit of a struggle (I can't even begin to count how many hours I've lost to simple typos...), I have great expectations of myself as I continue to study Computer Science.
