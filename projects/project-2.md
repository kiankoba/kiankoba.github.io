From the Fall 2016 semester to the Spring 2017 semester, I participated in the University of Manoa's Study Abroad program to Obirin University (桜美林大学) in Tokyo, Japan. During my time there, I stayed with a host family in Kanagawa prefecture. I communicated with them strictly in Japanese, and adhered to their house rules. I also studied various subjects at Obirin University, the majority of which were related to Japanese, such as Japanese composition and kanji.

During my stay in Japan, I became immersed in Japanese culture, and had to quickly adapt to the workings of their society. I learned how to ride the train, for example, and how when riding the train one should be quiet and keep their hands above their shoulders in order not to be suspected of groping someone near them when the train is crowded. I also learned to communicate with others, especially those who do not speak English as their first language, a skill that I believe to be valuable in a global setting.
